# nf-journey
Learning how to use nextflow using paired-end RNA-seqeuncing data.


#Just a few notes for users:

#After cloning the repo you should be able to simply run:

$ nextflow run main.nf -profile docker/singularity/apptainer

#This will run a single sample (ENCSR000COQ) through the simplified pipeline (that only creates a STAR index genome and aligns the fastq paired end data to the human genome)
#If you wanted to run the full variant calling pipeline then run:

$ nextflow run full_main.nf -profile docker/singularity/apptainer

# This pipeline does not have tests or nf-validation of parameters set up

# You can run your own samples using the --reads parameter (must be a string) 
# For ease: I have added a data folder that contains additional samples that you can use:

$ nextflow run main.nf -profile singularity --reads "data/reads/E*_{1,2}.fastq.gz"

#To run the tests:

$ nf-test test --profile docker/singularity/apptainer

#What I still want to do:
	- Add test configuration to -profile
		â—‹ Ensure configuration settings allow for GitActions
	- Use nf-validation and samplesheet.csv as input file
	- Add a final test that uses the snapshot tool
